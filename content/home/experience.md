  description = """I investigated strategies to reprogram the tumor microenvironment by promoting regulatory T cell (Treg) recruitment and exploring ways to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into more immune-responsive “hot” tumors. This work focused on strengthening anti-tumor immune activity by understanding how immune cell composition and signaling can be strategically shaped.

My hands-on work included PBMC isolation, cytokine-driven immune cell differentiation, and multi-color flow cytometry to characterize immune phenotypes and functional profiles. These approaches allowed me to analyze how immune cells shift under different stimulatory conditions and how those changes may influence tumor immunity.

I also contributed to in vivo immunotherapy studies using immunomodulatory agents to reprogram tumor-associated macrophages from a pro-tumor M2 state to an anti-tumor M1 phenotype. In parallel, I supported development of a receptor-targeted diagnostic strategy leveraging folate receptor expression as a potential tool for early cancer detection and limiting metastatic progression.

Through this work, I gained experience connecting cellular immunology with translational cancer strategies, learning how targeted immune modulation can influence therapeutic outcomes."""

Working closely with a PhD mentor, I helped execute experiments, troubleshoot protocols, and refine workflows, which strengthened both my technical precision and problem-solving skills. Through this work, I developed a deeper understanding of protein engineering, gene cloning strategies, and how molecular tools are used to investigate cell mechanics at a functional level."""
