Conducted a literature review on oncolytic viruses (OVs) as an emerging immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM), focusing on how engineered viruses selectively lyse tumor cells and stimulate anti-tumor immune responses. Analyzed key platforms such as adenovirus (DNX-2401) and HSV-based vectors, clinical trial outcomes, and major translational challenges including blood–brain barrier delivery, tumor immunosuppression, and viral neutralization. Also examined combination strategies with radiation and immune checkpoint inhibitors, highlighting the potential of viro-immunotherapy to overcome therapeutic resistance in aggressive solid tumors.
