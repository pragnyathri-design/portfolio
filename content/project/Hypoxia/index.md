Adapted the Bispecific Antigenic Immuno-Therapy (BAiT) platform to target hypoxic melanoma, where traditional therapies are often ineffective. Designed dual-hapten BAiT conjugates to bind CAIX⁺ tumor cells and recruit endogenous antibodies, activating immune effector responses (ADCC, CDC, ADCP). In vitro assays demonstrated selective binding and strong immune activation in CAIX⁺ CT-26 cells, while in vivo treatment significantly improved survival in tumor-bearing mice. These findings highlight BAiT’s potential as a novel antibody-recruiting strategy for treating hypoxia-driven cancers.
