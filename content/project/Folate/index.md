Developed and evaluated a novel immunotherapeutic strategy targeting Folate Receptor Alpha (FOLRα), a protein overexpressed in several cancers including ovarian, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The approach employs a heterobifunctional small molecule designed to bind FOLRα on tumor cells and recruit endogenous anti-hapten antibodies, triggering immune effector mechanisms such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Preliminary in vivo studies in 4T1 (triple-negative breast) and CT26 (colorectal) murine tumor models demonstrated strong anti-tumor activity, highlighting the potential of this antibody-recruiting platform for targeted cancer immunotherapy.

***Skills: antibody-recruiting platforms, folate receptor (FOLRα) targeting, tumor-targeted drug development, immune effector assays (ADCC, CDC), in vivo murine tumor models***
