Investigated how the gut commensal bacterium Hungatella hathewayi influences T cell–mediated immune responses using an in vitro EL4 T cell model. Stimulated cells with PMA and ionomycin in the presence of bacterial supernatants and assessed changes in cytokine production and cell function using flow cytometry and ELISA. Analyzed effects on pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, IL-17) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines as well as granzyme A production, revealing that H. hathewayi can modulate T cell activity and enhance anti-inflammatory properties under certain conditions. Findings contribute to understanding how gut microbiota shape immune regulation and inflammatory balance, with implications for inflammatory disease research.
